# Cartoonised-Image-Filter
This project applies a cartoon-style filter to images using **KMeans Clustering** for color simplification and **Gaussian Blur** for smoothing. It's a simple and fun way to transform ordinary photos into cartoon-like images using Python and OpenCV.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Converts real photos into cartoon-style images
- Uses **KMeans Clustering** for color quantization
- Applies **Gaussian Blur** for smoothing
- Adds sketch-like outlines using adaptive thresholding
- Customizable number of color clusters

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- **KMeans Clustering** â€“ Reduces color variety for stylized effect
- **Gaussian Blur** â€“ Smooths color transitions
- **Edge Detection** â€“ Uses adaptive thresholding for cartoon edges
- **Bitwise Masking** â€“ Combines edge map with simplified color image
